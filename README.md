Accurate and efficient brain tumor classification from MRI images is essential for early diagnosis and improved clinical decision-making. This study evaluates the performance of a baseline 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch against three state-of-the-art transfer learning models; ResNet50, DenseNet121, and EfficientNet-B0 to determine their effectiveness in multi-class brain tumor detection. Using a balanced dataset comprising glioma, meningioma, 
pituitary, and no-tumor images, all models were trained under identical conditions and assessed using accuracy, F1-score, class-wise performance, and computational efficiency. Results show that 
transfer learning models significantly outperform the baseline CNN, achieving faster convergence, stronger generalization, and reduced computational cost. EfficientNet-B0 achieved the highest 
validation accuracy (0.9297) and test accuracy (0.9271), along with superior class-wise performance, particularly in the visually challenging meningioma class. Despite balanced class 
distribution, meningioma remained difficult to classify due to subtle feature overlap with other tumor types. Overall, the findings demonstrate that transfer learning. especially EfficientNet-B0 
provides a highly effective and efficient approach for MRI-based brain tumor classification, offering strong potential for real-world medical imaging applications. Meanwhile classification and localization with YOLO models across nano, small, and
medium backbones show that YOLOv11n offers the best balance of speed and performance with an mAP50 of 0.915 on the test setand the fastest inference time (2.6 ms). Tumor-level results indicate strong performance for meningioma and pituitary tumors.
